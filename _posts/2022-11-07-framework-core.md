title: The Framework Core

There are different Layers, Processes, Connections, Dependencies and Terms used to cover a broad range of categories or "ingredients" for a Data Hub. This is how they work together:

The most important categories are:
* Data Scope
* Data Import Layer
* Operations Layer
* Data Hub Core
* Data Product
* Presentation Layer
* Value Creation and Enhancement Process

All of them describe a specific part of the whole concept. The parts are linked and related.  

You'll find the File also in the Download Section.
