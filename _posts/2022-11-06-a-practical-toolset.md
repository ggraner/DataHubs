title: Using a practical Framework as Toolset
---

Building an Operating Data Hubs introduces a practical framework as Toolset. The book should help to get a clear picture of your Data Environment and the interlink between your Data Products, your Databases, Data Warehouses and all your structured and unstructured Data.

No matter if there are Data Science and Machine Learning Applications or just standard Reports coming out of your Data Environment, building and operating Data Hubs can be similar to building a house. You need a stable foundation, planning, versatile tools, a great team with specific skills, good building materials and a vision.

This Framework is developed for Managers, Teamleaders, Founders, Investors, Developers, Business Analysts, System Architects, Risk Analysts or people who have recently changed jobs in that field. It should help to reduce complexity to get a better understanding of your Data Cosmos and based on that to make better decisions.
