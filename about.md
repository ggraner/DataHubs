The concept and the framework that are presented in this book evolved over the last few years after a professional journey of 15 years in IT and Data related positions within various industries from startups to large ngo organizations. The topic data and Data Hubs as well as data driven teams and businesses attracts more and more attention as we live in a reality of easily available information and data and their representation has become an integral part of our everyday life. Nowadays we mostly don't have a problem with information and data availability, we have a problem of how to process relevant data (and reduce noise of Data) out of an overwhelming Data Cosmos on different levels of integration. The field has been growing rapidly for years and there are no indications that this will stop. Therefore it is crucial to build Data Hubs that are long term lasting and persistent as well as easily adaptable to new situations. The other point is that existing and well functioning state of the art solutions have a natural expiry date due technical innovations and more powerful systems in the future. Upgrades and Migration can be complex, time consuming and very costly and most of the time they are. The practical framework should help to build and run Data Hubs in a sustainable way to meet each individual goal.

The Toolset is developed for Managers, Teamleaders, Founders, Investors, Developers, Business Analysts, System Architects, Risk Analysts, for people who are starting their professional career in a Data and Informational System context, or people who have recently changed jobs in that field.
